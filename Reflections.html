    <h2>28/06/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I started to create my website by beginning to code my Home page and this page (Reflections). I haven't found it challenging so far as I have completed these tasks before. </p>
    <h2>04/07/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I had a play around with adding images as a banner at the top of my page. As I don't actually know how to do this, I have been researching on W3 Schools to find a way that I can create this. I have discovered several ways that I can do this. The first is creating a hero image which is where an image fills the screen with text over the top. The second is inserting several images side by side to create this effect. The third is creating a collage and inserting it at the top of my page. The final way I have discovered is to create a moving banner which moves through some of my images. I haven't really made any progress in terms of coding my website but am finding ways that I can make my website look visually appealing. </p>
    <h2>06/07/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I discovered how to add a Hero Image at the top of my page and add text on top of it. This creates the visual look that I am after for my website. I created a collage of my showcased photography to be the image displayed as the Hero Image. Now I would like to insert a tab bar below the hero image which shows the different pages of my website. I have found a link on W3 Schools which shows me how to do this so this is how I will learn. I have created my pages which are ready to be linked to my main home page. </p>
    <h2>08/08/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I made lots of progress with not only functionality of my website, but also on the CSS and visial aspects of my website. I have developped a colour scheme which includes a burnt orange, light teal, dark purple, and light cream as my background. I also started looking font-families but am unsure as to how I am supposed to incorporate them into my website so I am going to ask for assistance from my teacher in the next lesson. Otherwise, I am very happy with my progress today. </p>
    <h2>15/08/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I have decided on how I am going to incorporate my colour scheme into varoius elements of my website. I have also started to insert all of my photography into my Portfolio page. I had some issues with my portrait images appearing landscape but after seeking the help of another teacher, we resolved the problem by creating a new copy of the image in a different file type. I am still struggling with how to change the font of my text. I have found a font that I would like to use, but don't know how to apply it.</p>
    <h2>28/08/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I figured out how to change my fonts on my website from an outside source. I am really happy with how it now looks and am now going to start on my A3 pages to hand in as my assessment. </p>
    <h2>01/09/2018</h2>
    <p>Today I finished my website. I have inserted all of my images onto my Portfolio page. I have linked the 'Coded with Brackets' text at the bottom of every page, to the Brackets website. I have semented my colour scheme and am happy with how my website looks. I am now going to begin constructing my A3 pages to hand in at the end of this coming week.</p>
